# Root cause and resolution

A new code base was uploaded and the reponsible for such task didn't run the tests before commiting his changes and uploading the code to production. After the problem was notified, the team run the tests to find the problem that caused the server going down, they discovered that it was just a typo the php file named wp-settings.php located in /var/www/html/, the issue that caused the problem was an invalid import due to a typo in the file extension of a module that was being imported, for instance the line that contained the typo wasrequire_once(ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.phpp'), knowing this, the team fixed the typo, then run the tests again uploaded the fixed version and then put the website back online.

# Corrective and preventing measures

After this incdent, the team automated the system control version to not allow uploas and merges of new code if the tests didn't passed, thus enforcing programmer to test their code before trying to upload to production.

New processes were implemented to avoid automtinc merge and deploy to production environment
A formative guide was given to ne employers to avoid similar issues
New tests were created
New updates to code were enforced to pass the tests
Programmers were formed to write new tests for the features they developed
The team implemented a new workflow using pull requests to review the code before merging
